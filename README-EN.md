## 🚀 My Portfolio in Action

I am currently focused on **software and infrastructure engineering**, with emphasis on **IaC (Infrastructure as Code)**, **Terraform**, and cloud-based solutions development.  
Here are **three active projects hosted on Fly.io** that demonstrate my hands-on journey:

- [Titanic Survival Prediction](https://titanic-survival-prediction.fly.dev/) → Machine Learning model deployed via API.
- [Java CRUD 2025 - Spring Boot](https://java-crud-2025-springboot.fly.dev/) → Robust CRUD application built with Spring Boot.
- [Noats](https://noats.fly.dev/) → Intelligent résumé generator optimized for ATS, built in Python.

These projects highlight my definitive transition from incident analyst to **software developer and infrastructure engineer**, proving what I am capable of building in practice.
